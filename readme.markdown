Gaps-Solitaire
==============

It was Christmas break, and I was playing "Full Deck Solitaire" to pass some time. I started playing a game called [Gaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps) which is a rather simple game. I started wondering if there was a similarly simple strategy that would have a good chance of success so I decided to turn the game into code and see. 

The implementation isn't exactly *playable* in the sense of a game, but it's runnable as a simulation with pluggable strategies.

It was also a way for me to continue to hone my Python skills.
