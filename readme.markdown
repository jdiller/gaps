Gaps-Solitaire
==============

It was Christmas break, and I was playing "Full Deck Solitaire" to pass some time. I started playing a game called [Gaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps) which is a rather simple game. I started wondering if there was a similarly simple strategy that would have a good chance of success so I decided to turn the game into code and see. 

The implementation isn't exactly *playable* in the sense of a game, but it's runnable as a simulation with pluggable strategies.

All of the coded strategies are pretty naive and usually win about 1.5-2.5% of the games.  The internet seems to suggest 5% is about what a 'good player' can expect to win. 

If by some miracle you find any of this code useful, you may have it under under the [WTFPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) - enjoy.
